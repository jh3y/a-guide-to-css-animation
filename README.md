## Getting started
You'll want to run `make setup`, `yarn`, or `npm i` to get started. This will install `browser-sync` locally so you can serve the demos on localhost.

Once installed, run `make serve` from the root of the repository.

Any changes you make to code in the `public` directory will be automatically reflected in the browser with live reload goodness! 😋
